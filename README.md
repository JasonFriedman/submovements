# submovements
This is code for the decomposition of velocity data into submovements

There are two versions: one for [Matlab](matlab) and one for [Python](python)

## Matlab
The matlab code requires the Optimization toolkit to be installed
The file [sample.m](matlab/sample.m) gives an example of how to use the toolkit

## Python
The [Juyptr](python/run_example.ipynb) notebook gives an example of how to use the python code

An older version of the (Matlab) code with more explanation can be found [here](https://noisyaccumulation.blogspot.com/2012/02/how-to-decompose-2d-trajectory-data.html)
